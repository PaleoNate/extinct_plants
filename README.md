# extinct_plants
This is a place for the paleobotany and paleo-art communities to find references to papers with illustrations of extinct plants that are based on direct evidence from the fossil record. This compilation was initally put together by Mario Coiro, with help from Nathan Jud and Andres Elgorriaga.

The list is an excel spreadsheet.
Each row represents a reconstruction of a species or community. 
Some species are known as "whole plants," whereas others are partial reconstructions (for example leaves on a branch).
To find what you are looking for, you can sort the spreadsheet by major plant groups, formation, continent, country, era, period, and more.
