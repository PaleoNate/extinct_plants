# extinct_plants
This is a place for the paleobotany and paleoart communities to find references to papers with illustrations of extinct plants that are based on direct evidence from the fossil record. This compilation was initally put together by Mario Coiro, with help from Nathan Jud and Andres Elgorriaga.

The list is a comma separated file (.csv) that can be opened in excel.
Each row represents a reconstruction of a species or community. 
Some species are known as "whole plants," whereas others are partial reconstructions (for example leaves on a branch).
To find what you are looking for, you can sort the spreadsheet by major plant groups, formation, continent, country, era, period, and more.

*Instructions for browsing the list of references.*
1) Navigate to the "paleobotany reconstructions reference" csv file
2) you should see the entries and be able to scroll through them.
3) Alternatively, download the file
4) Open in excel and search for what you need by sorting the spreadsheet

*Instructions for contributing a reference to the master list.*
1) Create a GitHub Account.
2) Fork the repository.
3) Edit the file to include your new reference (without commas).
4) commit your change.
5) submit a pull request to add you change to the master.
